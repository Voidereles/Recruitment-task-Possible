# Task
Recruitment-task-Possible

The recruitment task that I received from Possible consisted of turning psd into HTML/CSS template (as jpg it is available in this repository).

The conditions included in the brief that I got were as follows:
- we expect the site to be fixed, a fixed width matching 1024 pixels and centered in the browser
- picture gallery, showing 6 miniatures and one large picture
- arrows that you can scroll through thumbnails that are inactive if you can not scroll further
- the picture which the user chooses from among the thumbnails should be shown as the big main one
- name and job title on the big picture should only be shown when the mouse is over the image
- you can use Javascript libraries like jQuery, but not plug-ins creating a gallery like that in the requirements
- consider how the page will display on mobile devices

According to the last point, I made prototype of website on mobile site and I placed it there as pdf.
